                            according to New Horizons Language Center. I
                            started learning html, css and javascript before
                            starting university, currently looking for a job / paid

                        <h2>WHAT LEAD ME HERE</h2>
                        <p> 
                            Ever since I
                            was a child I was fascinated by computers and the things they are able to do, I would get on
                            the computer and play a videogame and have
                            fun on it, as the days went by, I got more and more attached to computers, at that time however, my English wasn't good, since I was just a child, 
                            so I set the goal as a child to learn English perfectly so I can play videogames and use computers without any problems, as the months and years went by, I found myself able to learn English and use it all on my own, and that was the first big milestone, with that I was also able to enter the field of tech taking any and all courses I needed and using all the resources I got online, currently I am still working on becoming the best programmer and the best version of myself that I could be, I am loving the path I took, and I am looking forward to all the interesting and fun experiences and people that share similar goals, people who want to leave a good mark on this earth.
